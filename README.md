# JavaScript Code Minifier

This is a toy JavaScript code minifier inspired by popular tools like UglifyJS and Terser. This project is intended for educational purposes to help understand the internals of code minifiers and code generators. It is **not** suitable for production use.

## Features

- **AST-based Minification**: Utilizes the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by Acorn to parse and transform JavaScript code.
- **Variable Name Mangling**: Shortens variable names to reduce code size.

## InProgress
- **Source Map Generation**: Creates source maps to track the original variable names, facilitating debugging.
